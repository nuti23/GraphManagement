# GraphManagement
 
Console user interface app which allows the user to perform CRUD operations on a graph. <br >
The graph can be read from a txt file or built by adding and/or removing nodes and/or vertices. Building a graph is also possible: by random generation. Saving a graph is performed by printing all the details of a graph in a .txt file (no. of nodes + no. of vertices + vertices and their costs).<br >
The app also shows the INBOUND & OUTBOUND of a node.<br >
The users can request the path (if there is one) between 2 nodes.<br >
BELLMAN FORD algorithm included.<br >
